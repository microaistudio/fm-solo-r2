 Git Backup Commands for Phase 1.5
Since you've completed Phase 1.5 (Settings management), here are the commands to create your backup checkpoint:
Step 1: Check Current Status
bash# See what files have been modified
git status

# View your recent commits
git log --oneline -5
Step 2: Stage and Commit All Changes
bash# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: complete settings management - Phase 1.5 done"
Step 3: Create Version Tag
bash# Create tag for this stable checkpoint
git tag v1.5 -m "Phase 1.5: Settings management complete"

# Verify tag was created
git tag -l
Step 4: Push to GitHub
bash# Push commits and tags to remote
git push origin main --tags

# Or if you haven't set upstream
git push -u origin main --tags
Step 5: Verify Backup
bash# Check that everything is pushed
git status
# Should show "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"

# Verify tag is on GitHub
git ls-remote --tags origin
🚨 If You Need to Recover Later
bash# To go back to this checkpoint
git checkout v1.5

# To create a new branch from this point
git checkout -b recovery-from-v1.5 v1.5
Once you've completed the backup, we can start on Phase 1.6 (Unit tests) with a clean checkpoint to revert to if needed! 👍
