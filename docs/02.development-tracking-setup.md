## 🚀 **Recommended Setup: GitHub Projects**

### **Step 1: Repository Setup**
```bash
# Create repository
git init flowmatic-solo-r2
cd flowmatic-solo-r2

# Add architecture document
curl -o ARCHITECTURE.md [download-link]
git add ARCHITECTURE.md
git commit -m "docs: add master architecture document"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/flowmatic-solo-r2
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 2: GitHub Projects Setup (5 minutes)**
```
1. Go to repository → Projects tab
2. Create "FlowMatic-SOLO R2 Development"
3. Choose "Board" template
4. Add columns: Backlog | In Progress | Testing | Done
5. Create 6 milestones for phases
6. Create issues for all deliverables
```

### **Step 3: Automation Rules**
```javascript
// Auto-move cards when PR merged
When PR merged → Move to "Done"

// Auto-assign to milestone
When issue created with "Phase 1" label → Add to "Phase 1" milestone

// Progress tracking
When issue closed → Update milestone progress
```

### **Step 4: Daily Workflow**
```bash
# Start work on issue #5 (Settings management)
git checkout -b feature/settings-management
git commit -m "feat: implement settings table - closes #5"
git push origin feature/settings-management

# Create PR (automatically links to issue #5)
# When merged → issue auto-closes → moves to "Done"
```

## 🎯 **Integration with Architecture Document**

### **Link Issues to Architecture Sections**
```markdown
Issue #1: Database Schema
📋 Architecture Reference: "Complete Database Schema" section
📋 Success Criteria: From architecture document  
📋 Code Location: src/database/schema.sql
📋 Tests: tests/database/schema.test.js
```

### **Quality Gates (From Architecture)**
```markdown
Phase 1 Complete When:
✅ All database operations atomic
✅ API endpoints respond correctly  
✅ Basic ticket flow works
✅ No hardcoded configurations
✅ Unit tests >80% coverage

Cannot start Phase 2 until all Phase 1 gates pass!
```

### **Architecture Compliance Checklist**
```markdown
Before each commit:
- [ ] Follows "state" terminology (never "status")
- [ ] Database operations are atomic
- [ ] API follows REST conventions
- [ ] Real-time events properly structured
- [ ] Raspberry Pi memory limits respected
```

## 🔥 **Pro Tips for Staying Synced**

### **1. Daily Review (5 minutes)**
```
Morning check:
- Review current phase progress
- Check if any blockers
- Confirm next 2-3 tasks
- Update estimates if needed
```

### **2. Weekly Phase Review**
```
End of week:
- Compare actual vs planned deliverables
- Identify what slowed progress
- Adjust next week's plan
- Update architecture if needed
```

### **3. Architecture Drift Prevention**
```
Before Phase completion:
- Review architecture document
- Confirm all requirements met
- Check for scope creep
- Validate success criteria
```

### **4. Automated Compliance**
```bash
# Git hooks to enforce architecture
pre-commit: Check for "status" vs "state" usage
pre-push: Run tests, check coverage
post-merge: Update project board
```
