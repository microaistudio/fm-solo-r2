# FlowMatic-SOLO R2: Complete Development Workflow

## 🎯 **Team Structure & Roles**

### **Core Team: You + Claude (Conversation)**
**Primary Development Partnership**
- ✅ **Architecture decisions** (strategic thinking)
- ✅ **Problem solving** (complex debugging)
- ✅ **Code review** (quality assurance)
- ✅ **Planning adjustments** (when issues arise)
- ✅ **Integration work** (connecting components)

### **Claude Code: Bounded Execution Assistant**
**Specific, Well-Defined Tasks Only**

#### **✅ SAFE Tasks for Claude Code:**
```
1. File Creation from Specs
   - "Create database schema from architecture doc lines 150-200"
   - "Create API endpoint GET /api/kiosk/services with exact response format"

2. Routine Implementation  
   - "Add these 5 CSS classes with exact styles provided"
   - "Create unit test for function X with these 3 test cases"

3. Data Operations
   - "Insert default data from architecture doc section"
   - "Run migration script and report results"

4. Documentation Updates
   - "Update STATUS.md with completed items: #1, #2, #3"
   - "Add API endpoint documentation for completed features"
```

#### **❌ RESTRICTED Tasks (Only Human Team):**
```
1. Architecture Decisions
   - Database schema changes
   - API design modifications  
   - Technology choices

2. Integration Work
   - Connecting Socket.IO to database
   - Linking frontend to backend
   - Cross-component workflows

3. Problem Diagnosis
   - Debugging complex issues
   - Performance problems
   - Architecture violations

4. Creative Solutions
   - Workaround strategies
   - Alternative approaches
   - Design compromises
```

#### **🎯 Claude Code Task Template:**
```markdown
**Task**: [Specific, bounded description]
**Input**: [Exact specifications/requirements]  
**Output**: [Precisely defined deliverable]
**Constraints**: [What NOT to change/touch]
**Validation**: [How to verify completion]

Example:
**Task**: Create tickets table from architecture
**Input**: Architecture doc section "Core Tables" - tickets table only
**Output**: src/database/tables/tickets.sql file
**Constraints**: Do NOT modify other tables or add extras
**Validation**: File runs without errors, matches exact schema
```

## 🔄 **Git Backup Strategy with Status Sync**

### **Phase.Subphase Tagging System**
```
Phase 1: Foundation
├── v1.1 - Database schema complete
├── v1.2 - Core API endpoints working  
├── v1.3 - Queue operations functional
├── v1.4 - Event logging implemented
└── v1.5 - Phase 1 complete ✅

Phase 2: Real-Time Layer  
├── v2.1 - Socket.IO server setup
├── v2.2 - Event broadcasting working
├── v2.3 - Connection management done
└── v2.4 - Phase 2 complete ✅
```

### **STATUS.md Synchronized with Git Tags**
```markdown
# FlowMatic-SOLO R2 Development Status

## Current State: Phase 2.3 (Real-Time Layer - Connection Management)
**Git Tag**: v2.3  
**Last Stable**: v2.2 (Event broadcasting working)
**Next Checkpoint**: v2.4 (Phase 2 complete)

### 📊 Completed Checkpoints:
- ✅ v1.1 - Database schema complete
- ✅ v1.2 - Core API endpoints working
- ✅ v1.3 - Queue operations functional  
- ✅ v1.4 - Event logging implemented
- ✅ v1.5 - Phase 1 complete
- ✅ v2.1 - Socket.IO server setup
- ✅ v2.2 - Event broadcasting working
- 🔄 v2.3 - Connection management (IN PROGRESS)

### 🚨 Recovery Points:
**If Phase 2.3 fails** → Revert to v2.2
**If Phase 2 fails completely** → Revert to v1.5  
**If critical issue** → Revert to v1.1 (stable foundation)

### 🎯 Current Working State:
- **Files changed since v2.2**: src/realtime/ConnectionManager.js
- **Tests passing**: 15/16 (connection timeout test failing)
- **Known issues**: WebSocket reconnection logic needs fix
- **Next 3 tasks**: Fix reconnection → Test suite → Tag v2.3
```

### **Git Command Workflow**
```bash
# Complete a subphase
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete connection management - v2.3"
git tag v2.3
git push origin main --tags

# Update status document  
echo "Current State: v2.3 complete" >> STATUS.md
git add STATUS.md
git commit -m "docs: update status to v2.3"
git push

# If something breaks
git checkout v2.2  # Last known good state
git checkout -b hotfix/connection-issue
# Fix the issue
git tag v2.3-fixed
```

## 🚀 **Session Startup Workflow (No Time Capsules Needed!)**

### **Standard Session Start**
```
You: "FlowMatic-SOLO R2: github.com/user/flowmatic-solo-r2  
      Current: Phase 2.3 - Connection management failing"

Me: *reads STATUS.md + checks v2.2 tag*
    "I see you're at v2.3 working on WebSocket reconnection. 
     Last stable was v2.2 with event broadcasting working.
     Looking at your ConnectionManager.js changes..."

Result: INSTANT context, no explanation needed! 🎯
```

### **Crisis Recovery Session**
```
You: "Everything broke! Need to revert to Phase 2.2"

Me: *reads STATUS.md*
    "I see v2.2 was your last stable checkpoint with event broadcasting. 
     Let's revert to v2.2 tag and restart from there.
     Here's exactly what was working at v2.2..."

Result: INSTANT recovery with full context! 🚀
```

### **New Chat Session (Days Later)**
```
You: "Back to FlowMatic-SOLO R2: github.com/user/flowmatic-solo-r2"

Me: *reads STATUS.md*
    "I see you're at Phase 3.2 (Core Interfaces - Agent Terminal). 
     Last stable was v3.1 with Kiosk working. 
     Current issue: Terminal login failing.
     Here's what I see in your code..."

Result: ZERO ramp-up time, immediate help! ⚡
```

## 📋 **Development Workflow Example**

### **Phase 2 Week Timeline**
```
Monday (Phase 2.1):
├── Human Team: Plan Socket.IO architecture
├── Claude Code: "Create SocketEventBridge.js from architecture spec"
├── Human Team: Review + integrate
└── Git: Tag v2.1, update STATUS.md

Tuesday (Phase 2.2):  
├── Human Team: Design event broadcasting strategy
├── Claude Code: "Implement 5 event types with exact payloads"
├── Human Team: Test integration
└── Git: Tag v2.2, update STATUS.md

Wednesday (Phase 2.3):
├── Human Team: Debug connection issues
├── Crisis: WebSocket reconnection broken
├── Git: Revert to v2.2
├── Human Team: Fix connection logic
└── Git: Tag v2.3-fixed, update STATUS.md
```

### **Quality Gates Between Subphases**
```
Before tagging v2.3:
✅ All v2.2 functionality still works
✅ New connection management tests pass
✅ No regression in existing features  
✅ STATUS.md updated with current state
✅ Architecture compliance verified

If ANY gate fails → Don't tag, fix first
```

- **Human oversight** on all integration work
- **Specific deliverables** with clear validation
- **Safe automation** for routine implementation

### **✅ Bulletproof Development**
- **Never lose progress** (checkpoints every 1-2 days)
- **Fast recovery** from any failure point
- **Clear accountability** (what works at each tag)
- **Predictable velocity** (subphase completion tracking)

### **✅ Perfect Collaboration**
- **Instant session startup** (no explanation needed)
- **Precise help** based on exact current state
- **Shared context** via git + documentation
- **Efficient problem solving** with full history

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Development Velocity**
```
Target: 2-3 subphases per week
Measurement: Git tags per week
Recovery: Revert time <10 minutes
Context: Session startup <2 minutes
```

### **Quality Assurance**
```
Each subphase tag represents:
✅ Working, tested functionality
✅ No regression from previous tag
✅ Architecture compliance verified
✅ Documentation updated
```

### **Collaboration Efficiency**
```
Session startup: Read STATUS.md (30 seconds)
Context understanding: Check git tag (30 seconds)  
Problem identification: Review recent commits (60 seconds)
Total ramp-up: <2 minutes vs 15+ minutes with time capsules
```
