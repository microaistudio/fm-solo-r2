### 📋 Phase 1 Final Status:
- [x] Database schema with all tables - ✅ Complete with indexes
- [x] Core API endpoints (80% coverage) - ✅ 5 working endpoints
- [x] Basic queue operations - ✅ Create/Call/Complete working
- [x] Event logging system - ✅ All operations logged
- [x] Settings management - ✅ GET/PUT working
- [ ] ~~Unit tests for core logic~~ - ⏭️ Skipped (will test with UI)

### 🚀 Phase 2 Checkpoints:
- [x] v2.1 - Socket.IO server with namespaces ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] v2.2 - Event broadcasting system ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] v2.3 - Connection management ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] v2.4 - Error handling & recovery
- [ ] v2.5 - Integration testing
- [ ] v2.6 - Phase 2 complete

### 🎯 Current Working State:
- **Current Task**: Phase 2.3 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 2.4
- **Completed in 2.3**: Room-based broadcasting, connection manager, heartbeat system
- **Next Tasks**: Error handling & recovery mechanisms
- **Known Issues**: None
- **Server Status**: Running with room-based broadcasting & heartbeat monitoring

### 🔧 Technical Stack:
- **Database**: SQLite 5.1.7 with transactions ✅
- **API**: Express on port 5050 ✅
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO 4.8.1 with broadcasting ✅
- **Core Modules**:
  - src/server.js - Main server (Socket.IO integrated)
  - src/app.js - Express app  
  - src/routes.js - API routes (broadcasting integrated)
  - src/database/connection.js - DB interface
  - src/database/events.js - Event logging
  - src/realtime/socketManager.js - Socket.IO namespaces (with heartbeat)
  - src/realtime/eventTypes.js - Event constants (9 outbound, 3 inbound)
  - src/realtime/eventBroadcaster.js - Room-based broadcasting
  - **NEW** src/realtime/connectionManager.js - Connection tracking
  - **NEW** src/realtime/heartbeat.js - Heartbeat monitoring

### 📊 Working Components:
**API Endpoints with Broadcasting** (5 working):
1. POST /api/kiosk/tickets ✅ (broadcasts ticket-created)
2. POST /api/terminal/call-next ✅ (broadcasts ticket-called)
3. POST /api/terminal/complete ✅ (broadcasts ticket-completed)
4. GET /api/admin/settings
5. PUT /api/admin/settings

**Socket.IO Features**:
- 4 namespaces: /kiosk, /terminal, /monitor, /customer
- 9 outbound events defined (including ticket-transferred)
- 3 inbound events defined
- Service-based event routing
- Real-time updates on all operations

### 🚨 Recovery Points:
**If Phase 2.3 fails** → Revert to v2.2  
**If connection management breaks** → Revert to v2.2
**Next stable checkpoint** → v2.3 (after connection management)

### 📅 Phase 2 Timeline:
- **Started**: 2025-06-25
- **Phase 2.1 Duration**: ~3 hours
- **Phase 2.2 Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Phase 2.3 Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Target**: 5-6 working days total
- **Progress**: 3/6 checkpoints complete (50%)

### 💡 Lessons Learned:
1. **SQLite3 on Windows** - Use v5.1.7 with pre-built binaries
2. **Namespace correction** - Changed /admin to /customer per architecture
3. **Socket.IO integration** - Server creates io instance, passes to manager
4. **Bounded tasks** - Keep Claude Code focused with specific instructions
5. **Event broadcasting** - Centralized in eventBroadcaster.js module

### 📝 Phase 2.2 Completion Notes:
- **Date**: 2025-06-26
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Features Added**:
  - Event broadcaster module with 4 functions
  - Broadcasting integrated into 3 API endpoints
  - All 9 event types defined
  - Service-based event routing
- **Next Steps**: Connection tracking and room management

### 📝 Phase 2.3 Completion Notes:
- **Date**: 2025-06-25
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Features Added**:
  - Room-based broadcasting in eventBroadcaster.js
  - Connection manager already existed
  - Heartbeat system (30s interval, 60s timeout)
  - Integration with socketManager and server
- **Files Modified**:
  - eventBroadcaster.js - Updated to use getNamespace and rooms
  - socketManager.js - Added heartbeat handlers
  - server.js - Start/stop heartbeat system
- **Files Created**:
  - heartbeat.js - Complete heartbeat monitoring
  - connection-test.js - Test script for room broadcasts

### 🎯 Next Actions:
1. Git backup with tag v2.3
2. Review Phase 2.4 subtasks (error handling)
3. Test the room-based broadcasting when server is running
4. Start Phase 2.4 - Error handling & recovery
